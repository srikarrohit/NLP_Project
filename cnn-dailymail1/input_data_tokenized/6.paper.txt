Noun compounds -LRB- NCs -RRB- such as -LCB- malaria mosquito -RCB- and \ textit -LCB- colon
cancer tumor suppressor protein -RCB- are challenging for text processing
since the relationship between the nouns they are composed of is
implicit .
NCs are abundant in English and understanding their semantics is
important in many natural language processing -LRB- NLP -RRB- applications .
For example , a question answering system might need to know whether
-LCB- protein acting as a tumor suppressor -RCB- is a good paraphrase for
-LCB- tumor suppressor protein -RCB- . Similarly , a machine translation
system facing the unknown noun compound -LCB- Geneva headquarters -RCB-
might translate it better if it could first paraphrase it as
-LCB- Geneva headquarters of the WTO -RCB- .
Given a query for -LCB- `` migraine treatment '' -RCB- , an
information retrieval system could use paraphrasing verbs like
-LCB- relieve -RCB- and -LCB- prevent -RCB- for query expansion and result
ranking .

Most work on noun compound interpretation has focused on two-word NCs .
There have been two general lines of research :
the first one derives the NC semantics from the semantics of the nouns it is made of -LCB- Rosario : 2002 , Moldovan : 2004 , Kim : 2005 , Girju : 2007a , Oseaghdha : 2009 , Tratz : 2010 -RCB- ,
while the second one models the relationship between the nouns directly
-LCB- Vanderwende : 1994 , Lapata : 2002 , Kim : 2006 , Nakov : 2006 : AIMSA , Nakov : 2008 , Butnariu : 2008 -RCB- .

In either case , the semantics of an NC is typically expressed by an
abstract relation like \ textsc -LCB- Cause -RCB- -LRB- e.g. , -LCB- malaria mosquito -RCB- -RRB- ,
\ textsc -LCB- Source -RCB- -LRB- e.g. , -LCB- olive oil -RCB- -RRB- , or \ textsc -LCB- Purpose -RCB- -LRB- e.g. ,
-LCB- migraine drug -RCB- -RRB- , coming from a small fixed inventory . Some
researchers
however , have argued for a more fine-grained , even infinite , inventory -LCB- Finin : 1980 -RCB- .
Verbs are particularly useful in this respect and can capture elements
of the semantics that the abstract relations can not .
For example , while most NCs expressing \ textsc -LCB- Make -RCB- , can be
paraphrased by common patterns like \ textit -LCB- be made of -RCB- and \ textit -LCB- be
composed of -RCB- , some NCs allow more specific patterns , e.g. , -LCB- be
squeezed from -RCB- for -LCB- orange juice -RCB- , and -LCB- be topped with -RCB- for
\ textit -LCB- bacon pizza -RCB- .


Recently , the idea of using fine-grained paraphrasing
verbs for NC semantics has been gaining popularity
-LCB- Butnariu : 2008 , Nakov : 2008 : AIMSA -RCB- ; there has also been a related
shared task at SemEval-2010 -LCB- SemEval : 2010Paraphrase -RCB- . This
interest is partly driven by practicality : verbs are directly usable
as paraphrases . Still , abstract relations remain dominant since they
offer a more natural generalization , which is useful for many NLP
applications .

One good contribution to this debate would be a direct study of the
relationship between fine-grained and coarse-grained relations for NC
interpretation . Unfortunately , the existing datasets do not allow this
since they are tied to one particular granularity ; moreover , they only
contain a few hundred NCs . Thus , our objective is to build a
large-scale dataset of hundreds of thousands of NCs , each interpreted
-LRB- 1 -RRB- by an abstract semantic relation and
-LRB- 2 -RRB- by a set of paraphrasing verbs .
Having such a large dataset would also help the overall advancement of the field .

Since there is no universally accepted abstract relation inventory in
NLP , and since we are interested in NC semantics from both a
theoretical and a practical viewpoint , we chose the set of abstract
relations proposed in the theory of \ newcite -LCB- Levi : 1978 -RCB- , which is
dominant in theoretical linguistics and has been also used in NLP
-LCB- Nakov : 2008 -RCB- .

We use a two-step algorithm to jointly harvest NCs and patterns -LRB- verbs
and prepositions -RRB- that interpret them for a given abstract relation .
First , we extract NCs using a small number of seed patterns from a
given abstract relation . Then , using the extracted NCs , we harvest
more patterns . This is repeated until no new NCs and patterns can be
extracted or for a pre-specified number of iterations .
Our approach combines pattern-based extraction and bootstrapping ,
which is novel for NC interpretation ; however , such combinations have
been used in other areas , e.g. , named entity recognition
-LCB- Riloff : 1999 , Thelen : 2002 , Curran : 2007 , McIntosh : 2009 -RCB- .

Responding to the need for semantic lexical resources in natural
language processing applications , we examine methods to acquire noun
compounds -LRB- NCs -RRB- , e

, \ emph -LCB- orange juice -RCB- , together with suitable
fine-grained semantic interpretations , e
@label
g
@label
, \ emph -LCB- squeezed from -RCB- ,
which are directly usable as paraphrases
@label
We employ bootstrapping
and web statistics , and utilize the relationship between NCs and
paraphrasing patterns to jointly extract NCs and such patterns in
multiple alternating iterations
@label
In evaluation , we found that having
one compound noun fixed yields both a higher number of semantically
interpreted NCs and improved accuracy due to stronger semantic
restrictions
